## What is this app?

The PTO Tracker helps you ask for time off from work. PTO stands for "Paid Time Off." This app lets you:

- Ask for vacation days
- Ask for sick days
- Tell your manager when you need to miss work
- See how many days off you have left

Your manager uses this app to say "yes" or "no" to time off requests.

For example, if you ask for Monday through Friday off, that is 5 work days or 37.5 hours.

### Holidays

These days are holidays and do not count against your time off:
- New Year's Day
- Martin Luther King Jr. Day
- Presidents Day
- Memorial Day
- Juneteenth
- Independence Day (July 4th)
- Labor Day
