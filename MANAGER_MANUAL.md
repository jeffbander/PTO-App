## Helpful Tips

### How Time Off is Calculated

- A full work day is **7.5 hours**
- Weekends do not count as work days
- Holidays do not count as work days

For example, if someone asks for Monday through Friday off, that is 5 work days or 37.5 hours.

### Holidays

These days are holidays and do not count against time off:
- New Year's Day
- Martin Luther King Jr. Day
- Presidents Day
- Memorial Day
- Juneteenth
- Independence Day (July 4th)
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving
- Christmas

### PTO Refresh

Employee time off balances reset once a year on their refresh date. You can see and update refresh dates in the employee profile.
